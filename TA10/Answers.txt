1.  There will be no output at all from the function. f3 does not release the lock so f4 function will be stuck
    and will never enter the block. Since we used join in the main, we have to wait till f4 is finished, but it will
    never happen, so there will be no output.









2.  In row 44 we need to add f3_lock.release() in order to release the RLock and then f4 can work.
    another answer will be in row 44












3.  The output will be [1]















4.  The use of the stack is not thread safe. although we used locks, the function of the stack are not thread safe,
    so using the function of the stack are not thread safe.
